Dataset Description
This dataset provides detailed information on the academic performance and demographic characteristics of high school students from three different schools in the United States. It includes data on students' grades in various subjects, alongside demographic details such as age, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.

Key aspects of the dataset include:

Grades: Scores achieved by students in subjects such as Math, Science, English, and History. This can help analyze academic performance trends across different disciplines.
Demographic Information: Data such as age, gender, and ethnicity, which allows for analysis of performance trends among different demographic groups.
School Information: Details about the schools, which may include location, type (public or private), and resources available, providing context for comparing performance across different environments.
This dataset can be used to explore various factors influencing academic performance, identify potential disparities, and inform educational strategies and policies.

Conclusion
In this analysis, we utilized a dataset containing detailed information on the academic performance and demographic background of high school students from three U.S. schools. The dataset included key columns such as Roll No, Gender, Section, Parental Level of Education, Lunch status, Test Preparation Course completion, and scores from Practical, Viva, and Exam tests.

The primary task was to predict students' Exam scores based on these features. By analyzing these variables, we aimed to understand how different factors, such as gender, parental education, and participation in test preparation courses, influence students' academic outcomes. The insights gained from this analysis can help educators and policymakers identify areas for targeted interventions, aiming to improve academic performance and equity among students.

Further analysis could involve refining prediction models or exploring additional factors to enhance the accuracy of predictions and deepen our understanding of the determinants of student success.
